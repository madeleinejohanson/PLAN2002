###Grasshopper Components
Currently two Grasshopper components exsist used for writing and reading GeoJSON. 
####Polygon to GeoJSON 
#####Inputs
Polyline Curve: Polygon to convert to GeoJSON <br>
Key: Properties used to describe geoemtry<br>
Value: <br>
To specify the height, base height and colour of the polygon on Mapbox, use the following keys: 
    height
    base_height
    colour 
Please note that the keys are case sensitive. 
The list should be structured so that the first branch of data is associated with the first key. This allows unique values to be associated with multiple polygons.
