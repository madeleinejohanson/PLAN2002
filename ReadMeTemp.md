##Grasshopper Components
Currently two Grasshopper components exsist used for writing and reading GeoJSON. 
###Polygon to GeoJSON 
#####Polyline Curve (P)
Polygon to convert to GeoJSON 
#####Key (K)
Properties used to describe geoemtry
#####Value(V)
Associated values of properties.The list should be structured so that the first branch of data is associated with the first key. This allows unique values to be associated with multiple polygons.

<br>
To specify the height, base height and colour of the polygon on Mapbox, use the following keys:

    height
    base_height
    colour 
    
Please note that the keys are case sensitive.
