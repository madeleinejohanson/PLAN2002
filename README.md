hypothesis
specific aim
Background
developing the pipe between gh and website, creating flexible tools between the client and the architect
Description (explain...)
project aims and effects, improve design culture and explore computational design, engage the community in urban design outcomes and solutions by providing clear contextual graphical simulations, show variables and relationship of design proposals, theories, communicating to the pulic about issues and their solutions - environment, transport, cadaster, aestheic judgement, transport connections
Informed opinion with simulations, allows an informed community discussion, psycology behind decisions
structure of scripts,  collaboration, computational design. algorithicmally deal with computational urban space possibilties
