#UrbanCoDe
This the documentation and practical work of Madeleine Johanson and Nazmul Azim Khan, conducting their Computational  Design Honours research at UNSW and in collaboration with COX Architects Sydney.  Their previous study at COX included developing a data 'pipe' between computational tools such as grasshopper and web platforms, enabling designers to create computational tools to perform tasks with a simpler user interface. This visual, graphical interface therefore has the potential to  increase communication not only between the architect and the client, but also within the architectural firm. <br>
Continuing on from this research, the students will aid in the developmental 'urban pinboard.' Urban Pinboard is a new tool for collaboration that connects the public, private and community sectors in a single conversation with innovative digital technology to drive smart city transformation. Urban Pinboard will be also unique and powerful because, unlike other one-way e-platforms in use around the world, it will allow these three sectors to not just access data but also exchange their ideas, thus creating a real and powerful feedback loop.Hence it can be considered as a library of open urban data, represented graphically in a global map interface. The platform creates an interface between unreadable datasets and its users such as government policies, survey information and development proposals. UrbanPinboard has the potential to unlock communication barriers through technology, and produce accurate data flows where site potential can be determined through a dynamic platform.<br>

research question <br>
The current research project, UrbanCoDe, aims to be an invaluable to the community and architects alike. With an aim to improve design culture and equality of information, design proposals can be presented to the public in a clear graphical format, engaging the wider community of Sydney in urban design outcomes and solutions. Creating a platform for informed community discussion,  individuals  actively engage in public issues and solutions, allowing  a glimpse into the psychology behind decision making processes. Aspects such as environment, transport connections and aesthetics can be judged for their function and form.  Design variables and their relationships to one another ca be simulated and understood. This exploration into the capabilities of computational design showcases how we can algorithmically deal with urban space possibilities.

Using resources such as GitHub and mapbox, we can host, develop and test our own platform before merging with UrbanPinboard. No budget is needed to access mapbox's database to test, however with UrbanPinboard,  data must be bought from the government. <br>

###Project Progress 

how geoJSON works (attributes, features etc)
what grasshopper needs
what html is needed
show testing
explicitly say what you are not doing
eg workflows: exporting from gh, compatible with mapbox
add images of gh - tool to be packaged soon
